## 0-run 

This scripts runs a python script.
The python file name will be saved in the environment variable **$PYFILE**.

## 1-run\_inline

This scripts runs a python code.
The python code will be saved in the environment variable **$PYFILE**.

## 2-print

The python script prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"

## 3-print\_number

Completed the [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py) to print an integer stored in the variable **number**, followed by **Battery street**
````shell
98 Battery street
````
## 4-print\_float

Completed the [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py) to print the float stored in the variable **number** with a precision of 2 digits.

````shell
FLOAT: 3.14
````

## 5-print\_string

Completed the [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py) in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

## 6-concat

Completed this [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py) to print Welcome to Holberton School!

````shell
Welcome to Holberton School!
````

## 7-edges

Completed the [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py)

- **word\_first_3** contains the first 3 letters of the variable *world*
- **word\_last\_2** contains the last 2 letters of the variable *word*
- **middle\_word** contains the value of the variable *word* without the first and last letters

````shell
First 3 letters: Hol
Last 2 letters: on
Middle word: olberto
````
## 8-concat\_edges

Completed this [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/8-concat_edges.py) to print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line

## 9-easter\_egg

Wrote the Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.

````shell
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## 10-check\_cycle

### Technical interview preparation:
Implemented the function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

- Prototype: **int check_cycle(listint_t \*list);**
- Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle

````shell
1024
402
98
4
3
2
1
0
Linked list has no cycle
Linked list has a cycle
