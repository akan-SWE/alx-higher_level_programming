## 0-positive_or_negative

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Completed the [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program

- The output of the program should be:
    - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
    - if the number is 0: is zero
    - if the number is less than 0: is negative

## 1-last_digit

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Completed the [source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program

- The output of the program should be:
    - The string Last digit of, followed by
    - the number, followed by
    - the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
    - if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
    - if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
    - if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0

## 2-print_alphabet

Wrote the program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

``` shell
./2-print_alphabet.py
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzguillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$
```

##  3-print_alphabt

Wrote the program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

- Print all the letters except q and e

``` shell
 ./3-print_alphabt.py
abcdfghijklmnoprstuvwxyzguillaume@ubuntu:~/0x01$
```

## 4-print_hexa

Wrote the program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)

``` shell
./4-print_hexa.py
0 = 0x0
1 = 0x1
2 = 0x2
3 = 0x3
4 = 0x4
5 = 0x5
6 = 0x6
7 = 0x7
8 = 0x8
9 = 0x9
10 = 0xa
11 = 0xb
12 = 0xc
13 = 0xd
14 = 0xe
15 = 0xf
16 = 0x10
17 = 0x11
18 = 0x12
...
96 = 0x60
97 = 0x61
98 = 0x62
```
